  ### RESOURCE SETTINGS (when launched with rackup)
    
  # Number of child processes allowed in the fork mode. When the number of

  # Seconds from build completion time until build will be expired from server. 
  # Set this value to -1 to never expire builds, such as if the server is being 
  # used as a third-party provider for other site's CSS, JS and image assets.
  build_expiration: -1
  
  # Seconds before an incomplete workspace (such as one queued or hung) is 
  # expired. This should be longer than it takes the build server to run a

  # value to -1 to never expire incomplete workspaces.
